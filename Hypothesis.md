I hypothesize that in samples that test positive and negative occupancy, environmental covariates will be distributed differently.

To test this statistically, I think the best approach is to compare the distributions of my environmental covariates between two groups, samples that test positive and samples that test negative for occupancy. 

I believe a Mann-Whitney U test could be appropriate to test this hypothesis.

**BMB**: this is an odd **scientific** hypothesis. It does sometimes make sense to invert scientific hypotheses around for statistical purposes, but this seems like it might be scientifically backward - wouldn't it make more sense to ask how environmental covariates predict occupancy (which you can do with logistic regression)?. Another problem with classic nonparametric tests is that they don't give you interpretable effect sizes and confidence intervals ...)

mark: 1.9 (both parts of this assignment are slightly lacking)
