I hypothesize that in samples that test positive and negative occupancy, environmental covariates will be distributed differently.

To test this statistically, I think the best approach is to compare the distributions of my environmental covariates between two groups, samples that test positive and samples that test negative for occupancy. 

I believe a Mann-Whitney U test could be appropriate to test this hypothesis.
