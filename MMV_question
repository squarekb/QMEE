This feels like a trick question to me. But, if the rapid MMV test has a 5% chance of a false positive, and a 0% chance of a false negative, I believe this person who tests positive on a rapid test has a 95% chance of having MMV.

If you learn that your friend tests positive for MMV, tell them that there is a 95% chance that they do in fact have MMV, and that there is a 5% chance that they don't. Ask them a few questions about mathemetical models to develop your own hypothesis about their condition.
